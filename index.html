							<p><em>Update 2016-08-24 05:01:50</em><br/>
							After several restarts and a bit of time this resolved itself. However, this is hardly the first time I have seen this issue today or in general with AppVeyor's API. Maybe we need to use a similar strategy to one used with Travis CI's API.

						<span class="title">Travis CI OS X Backlog</span>
						<p>Seems that there is some serious issue affecting Travis CI builds and causing them to wait for long periods on the queue. Have raised this issue upstream as ( https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6515 ) to see if they have any ideas as to what is going on and if we can get it fixed.

For the meantime, I'd like to ask people to nice builds. If you see multiple builds for a PR at staged-recipes, please cancel all older version of it. If you are planning any large running builds, please hold off on them until we can track down this issue. It does seem some builds are getting processed, but it appears to be very slowly and long after they were initiated.

Please bear with us as we try to sort out this issue.</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-24 03:12:44</em><br/>
							Reducing to degraded as we seem to actually have some things running on the queue now. Also looks like the number of jobs running is starting to fall off. Will continue to monitor the situation.
							</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-24 18:47:04</em><br/>
							Travis CI has now [announced]( https://www.traviscistatus.com/incidents/4mvp857qx8bw ) that they are stopping all OS X builds due to instability in their OS X infrastructure. Upgrading this to major outage.

It is possible this was in part a consequence of trying to handle recipes that were already converted. Alternatively this could be caused by some issues with AppVeyor's API.</p>

							A new [build]( https://travis-ci.org/conda-forge/staged-recipes/builds/153689664 ) was created with the merge of PR ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1312 ) that does not have any of the converted feedstocks in it to finish the conversion. Will wait and see how that build progresses.

							<p><em>Update 2016-08-19 22:45:31</em><br/>
							This appears to have resolved this issue. staged-recipes is now clear.

							Running into this issue again. So am reopening. See this [build]( https://travis-ci.org/conda-forge/staged-recipes/jobs/153845433 ). Traceback included below. Have tried restarting once, but it failed. Will try again.

							<p><em>Update 2016-08-20 21:45:27</em><br/>
							Tried to add PR ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1317 ) to ensure we were using the latest set of recipes at staged-recipes. It seems Travis CI likes to checkout commits now and so can sometimes be out-of-date. Doesn't appear this made any difference. See this [build]( https://travis-ci.org/conda-forge/staged-recipes/jobs/153849261 ), which has the same failure.
							</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-20 21:49:37</em><br/>
							Attempting to temporarily remove `argparse` as it is having trouble getting converted ATM. Will try to re-add afterwards. See PR ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1318 ) for this temporary removal.
							</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-20 21:56:08</em><br/>
							Removing `argparse` made no difference as the next recipe in the list has the same [problem]( https://travis-ci.org/conda-forge/staged-recipes/jobs/153850184 ). Went ahead and re-added `argparse` with PR ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1319 ).
							</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-20 22:01:21</em><br/>
							Weird. Apparently after re-adding `argparse` we were able to get everything working again. All of the recipes are now converted.

							<p><em>Update 2016-08-18 23:58:53</em><br/>

							</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-19 00:32:22</em><br/>
							All of the restarted builds appear to have passed and uploaded packages FWICT. If others can confirm, that would be great. Going to go ahead and close for now assuming this is resolved.
							</p>
						
							<p><em>Update 2016-08-19 05:10:29</em><br/>
							Yeah, was just noticing this with a different CircleCI [build]( https://circleci.com/gh/conda-forge/statuspage-feedstock/12 ) just now. That build was from a few days ago. Going to elevate this issue.

							In some cases, am also seeing a new failure when rerunning an existing build that had already uploaded. This rerunning is being done in order to resolve some of the failed uploads.
