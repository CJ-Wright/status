<blockquote>
  <p>We corrected a bug where we were allowing forked PR builds to run on Open Source projects even if that feature was disabled.</p>
  
  <p>To go back to the functionality you are used to, please enable <code>Permissive building of fork pull requests</code> in the advanced settings for the project on CircleCI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, it sounds like we were relying on a bug for PRs to work at all.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 16:15:06 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Should note that under this setting I see the following text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are serious security concerns with this setting (see the documentation for details.) If you have SSH keys, sensitive env vars or AWS credentials stored in your project settings and untrusted forks can make pull requests against your repo, then this option isn't for you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not something that inspires confidence. ðŸ˜ž This may mean things deploy prematurely from PRs if these environment variables are exposed. Am asking CircleCI about this.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 16:28:17 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>I do not think there are any security concerns for us.  According to that document:</p>

<p><code>
The variables configured via the circle.yml will be available in the fork PR builds 
(as they have access to the same circle.yml file); the values configured through 
the UI will not be visible to the fork PRs
</code></p>

<p>I believe that the anaconda.org upload token is stored as a secure variable via the UI and therefore is not visible in PRs.  This would be the only variable that I can think of that needs to be protected. </p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 16:35:17 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Going to <code>Settings</code> (the gear icon), <code>Advanced Settings</code> and switching the <code>Permissive building of fork pull requests</code> setting to <code>On</code> does in fact re-enable Circle CI build on pull requests.  I turned this on in the <code>python-feedstock</code> and the PR I submitted is building on Circle (conda-forge/python-feedstock#96).  </p>

<p>I think this will need to be done for all feedstocks.  It might be worthwhile to ask Circle CI if they can do this for all the <code>conda-forge</code> repositories as manually updating 1000+ settings will be a pain.  </p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 16:49:05 UTC</span></em></p>
							<blockquote>
  <p>I do not think there are any security concerns for us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope you are right. Which document are you referring too?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It might be worthwhile to ask Circle CI if they can do this for all the <code>conda-forge</code> repositories as manually updating 1000+ settings will be a pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also am asking about that too. It seems they don't have an API for us to do it. So even if we fix all of our repos, we will be stuck doing this manually when it comes to new repos.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 16:52:50 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>I'm looking at the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/fork-pr-builds/">Building Pull Requests from forks</a> document.  The odd part is that according to that document pull request builds should be turned on for public GitHub repositories (including conda-forge) by default.  I would be interested in seeing if <code>Permissive building of fork pull requests</code> is turned on for a newly created feedstock or not.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 17:08:41 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Should be easy to find out. ðŸ˜‰</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 17:18:48 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Thanks for looking into this @jakirkham.  I have some day job work that needs attention but will be back tonight to keep the ball moving towards <code>conda build</code> 2!</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 20:01:45 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>So apparently turning on <code>Permissive build of fork pull requests</code> also exposes the Environment Variables for the repository to pull requests which results the package being uploaded from the pull request's Circle CI builds rather than after merging, for example in this <a href="https://circleci.com/gh/conda-forge/glib-feedstock/49?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=github-build-link">glib build</a>. </p>

<p>That is a serious security concern as packages are getting uploaded without review and the upload token could can be exposed by a malicious PR.  </p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 20:04:06 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Thanks for confirming this. Will ask what we can do about it.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 20:16:39 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Ahh wait.  Apparently this behavior is what <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/fork-pr-builds/#unsafe-fork-pr-builds">is expected</a> when the <code>Project fork pull requests</code> toggle is set.  So we should definitely <strong>NOT</strong> be doing that, sorry I suggested it.</p>

<p>Still does not explain why pull requests were not triggering builds.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 20:32:46 UTC</span></em></p>
							<blockquote>
  <p>Still does not explain why pull requests were not triggering builds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The explanation is we were relying on a "bug" to get pull requests to work before. Yesterday they "fixed" the "bug". Though IMHO it was a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/ ">feature</a> and they just broke it. ðŸ˜¢</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-07 20:37:32 UTC</span></em></p>
							<blockquote>
  <p>Though IMHO it was a feature and they just broke it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and a very important feature at that.  It looks like the same thing is happening with the Circle CI build on SciPy.  I've opened an issue (scipy/scipy#6839) to track the issue there as well.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-08 06:39:59 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>CircleCI said they are looking into it. Let's wait and see what comes out of it.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-12 22:42:30 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>What are CircleCI thinking?!? Why would you <em>ever</em> want to expose your secrets through forked PRs? If you do actually want them exposed, you don't need to call them secret because anybody can echo them... it is a completely illogical move for open source, and a huge bug in their design.</p>

<p>Do you have a GitHub issue that we can xref?</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-16 18:28:08 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Well, they have added a setting since that appears to disable exposing your secrets in a forked PR build. FWIW that appears to be off. I might try experimenting with this in one feedstock and see how it goes.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-22 07:50:09 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>The current workaround is to enable CircleCI on one's own fork of the feedstock or staged-recipes and push new changes to get it to trigger with the other CIs.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2016-12-24 02:29:29 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Should add that another consequence of this problem is that sometimes recipes pending conversion in staged-recipes will be included in CircleCI builds as we are no longer able to do proper builds of PRs, but are instead having users build on their own fork. Fortunately it should not take away from the org queue on CircleCI though.</p>

							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-04 18:38:46 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Was able to enable CircleCI builds on staged-recipes. To do this generally on a feedstock, one has to navigate to the repo settings on CircleCI (gear in the upper right hand corner). Then select "Advanced Settings" in the left panel. Finally enable "Build forked pull requests" only. After doing this one must close and reopen the PR. This likely requires administrative privileges on CircleCI. Screenshot below.</p>

							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-08 17:25:30 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>You can enable this setting for all feedstocks by capturing the request for one feedstock for changing the setting in your browser (A request to https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/conda-forge/mpc-feedstock/settings) and then replaying it after changing the repo name in the url and payload.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-08 21:05:30 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Yeah, what I would really like to do is get this added to <code>conda-smithy</code>. Partly so that we can roll out this change on all feedstocks. Also partly to make sure new feedstocks have the right settings.</p>

<p>Guessing I should try using Selenium for implementing this, but maybe that is too much for clicking one radio button. Other suggestions welcome.</p>

<p>On a finer grained detail, I had looked at the source before and found even though I could identify the radio button. The source did not make it very clear which radio button belonged to which setting. My concern here is if I set everything up with say radio button 9 now and they change the settings latter, we could be getting the totally wrong behavior. So it would be nice if there was a good way of finding the setting name and then the radio button next to that setting. Any suggestions on this would be appreciated. </p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-09 03:09:00 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>I checked and the following works.
<code>
curl 'https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/conda-forge/mpc-feedstock/settings?circle-token=mytoken' -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' -H 'Accept: application/json' --data-binary '{"feature_flags":{"build-fork-prs":true}}'
</code>
Here mytoken needs to be replaced by a valid token.
Implemented here, conda-forge/conda-smithy/pull/420</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-09 05:44:12 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>After working with @isuruf on his proposal for <code>conda-smithy</code>, I think we have a working fix. Have used it to enable CircleCI builds for PRs on all current feedstocks. Please take a look at the PR if you are interested.</p>

<p>IMHO we should get this CircleCI fix in, the re-rendering index fixes, and <code>conda</code> 4.2 fixes in. Then we should be in good shape for a healthy release.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-10 23:34:42 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Reopening until we actually release the new <code>conda-smithy</code> that will fix this issue.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-11 21:17:05 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Changed to degraded performance as many feedstocks are functioning at this point.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-13 18:35:11 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p><code>conda-smithy</code> 2.0.0 is released and in action at staged-recipes. This release includes an important fix by @isuruf that enables CircleCI builds of PRs from forks on new feedstocks. So all new feedstocks should not have this issue. Also have applied this fix to all existing feedstocks. Therefore this should no longer be a problem for any feedstocks. Will close this out.</p>

<p>Fine print: We are using a non-public API to do this as there is no public API for it. So it may be changed in the future without warning.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-01-13 19:09:03 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Should add that I have asked CircleCI to make this part of the Public API. We'll see what they say.</p>

Have raised this issue upstream as ( https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6515 ) to see if they have any ideas as to what is going on and if we can get it fixed.</p>

<p>For the meantime, I'd like to ask people to nice builds. If you see multiple builds for a PR at staged-recipes, please cancel all older version of it. If you are planning any large running builds, please hold off on them until we can track down this issue.

  <p>...there seem to be a long backlog on travis of staged-recipes again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This status issue is on a different problem with Travis CI a long time ago. If there are new issues, I would recommend raising one. Though we are certainly aware of backlog issues with Travis CI that have been occurring recently.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...how do I cancel the expired PRs? There is no such option from my travis login.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Travis CI does not extend that privilege to anyone that does not have write access to the repo. I had put together a script ( https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-build-setup-feedstock/pull/52 ) that would terminate old PR builds early and could be used at staged-recipes ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/2264 ) or feedstocks (once the dust settles on the first two). However, it seems to be stuck in discussion ATM. Feel free to nudge it along if you think it is important.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2017-02-06 04:42:12 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p>Well this problem seems to show up on a weekly basis during the work week. So IMHO this is a big problem as it mucks with people's ability to get work done. That said, you are right it goes away on the weekend.</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to enabling on your fork. Pro being it is on your own queue vs conda-forge's. Con it still adds to the overall Travis CI queue and it fails to do things like test on the merge commit. Probably not worthwhile to enable Travis CI on your fork in the end.</p>
